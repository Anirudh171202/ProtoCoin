## Using Cryptocurrency for Science 



Cryptocurrency has great potential as a decentralized form of currency. However, each transaction on the blockchain involves a huge amount of computation which has a sizable carbon footprint in the form of electricity and electronic waste. What if we could make these operations fruitful?

We, at Protocoin, have come up with a unique approach to this problem: using crypto operations to enable scientists and researchers to solve the great problems of our time. To begin with, we have developed a framework for biomedical and genomics researchers to assemble genes (via a process called de-novo assembly) through Protocoin. Conventionally, systems for such operations require intensive computational power and cost almost $100,0000. Through Protocoin, such operations could be accomplished at minimal cost while effectively utilizing the computational power of cryptocurrency.

Beyond gene assembly, this technology can be applied to many pressing problems in biology, astronomy, mathematics, computer science, and earth systems. Protocoin has the potential to be the most sustainable cryptocurrency the world has yet seen.
